# Rock paper scissors

![rpss](photo/rpss.jpg)

I made a simple rock paper scissors game by using the randint function choose a random number and makeing that number either rock, paper or scissors.
The idea to correlate the items with the numbers just popped up into my head one day and I wrote it down.

## How to actually play the game

Type in the text below in the terminal to play.

``` python
python RPS_test.py
```
